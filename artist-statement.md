# Artist Statement

Road Trip is an interactive digital art piece that captures the harmony between humans and nature in modern life through simple geometric shapes and soft colors. The work presents the interior of a car from the driver's perspective. Through the windshield, the viewer can see a country road stretching to the horizon, symbolizing an unknown journey and the hope of the future. The sun and moon represent the passage of time during the journey, while the adorable dog in the passenger seat gazes at the viewer, conveying a sense of companionship.
The retro-style radio and steering wheel evoke the viewer's appreciation for the simple joys of everyday life. The text prompt at the bottom of the screen humorously breaks the fourth wall, inviting the viewer to interact with the dog, steering wheel, radio buttons, and the sky within the scene. By placing the viewer in the role of the driver on a journey, the artist invites us to reflect on the sense of direction, companionship, and connection with nature in modern life. Road Trip is not only a celebration of the beautiful moments in daily life but also a gentle call for inner peace and self-discovery.
